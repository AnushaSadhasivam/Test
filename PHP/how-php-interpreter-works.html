    <p class="text-align-justify">PHP, as is the case with many other languages used for web applications, is an
      interpreted language. When running an application written in PHP, we usually don’t think what really happens to
      its code during the execution. In this article you will learn how the finished code is processed by a PHP
      interpreter.</p>
    <h2 class="text-align-justify">Compilation and interpretation</h2>
    <p class="text-align-justify">Compiled languages, such as, for example, C, C++, differ from interpreted languages
      due to the fact that their processing into machine code is performed only once. After the compilation process, you
      can run the application many times without the need for another compilation. Once the application is compiled,
      there is no additional time overhead for its subsequent processing, but its development process is also more
      difficult (changes require recompilation). Alternatively, we have interpreted languages, such as PHP, Python and
      Ruby. They are less efficient as their code is processed by a separate application (an interpreter) that
      translates the application code "on the fly". Such a strategy means lower performance and application execution
      time, but on the other hand – it allows for greater flexibility and ease of software development. So, let us take
      a closer look at how a PHP interpreter works.</p>
  </section>
  <h2 class="text-align-justify">Zend Engine</h2>
  <p class="text-align-justify"><a href="https://www.zend.com/" target="_blank">Zend Engine</a> is both the engine and
    the very heart of the PHP language. It consists of a source code to bytecode compiler and a virtual machine that
    executes this code. It is comes directly with PHP – when you install PHP, you install Zend Engine at the same time.
    It is responsible for the whole code processing, from the moment your HTTP server sends the requested PHP script
    execution to it, until the HTML code is generated and returned to the server. To put it simply, the whole processing
    of a PHP script is carried out by the interpreter in four stages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="text-align-justify">lexical analysis (lexing),</li>
    <li class="text-align-justify">syntax analysis (parsing),</li>
    <li class="text-align-justify">compilation,</li>
    <li class="text-align-justify">execution.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-align-justify">With the introduction of the OPcache mechanism, the whole process can be basically
    skipped until the last step - launching/executing the application on a virtual machine. The situation becomes even
    more comfortable if you know what's new in
    PHP version 8. I mean of course the JIT compiler that allows you to compile PHP code. As a result, it is possible to
    run the
    machine code directly - bypassing the process of interpretation or execution by a virtual machine.</p>
  <p class="text-align-justify">I would like to add that in the past there was another curious option - code
    transpilation, e.g., into the C++ language. Such a solution was used in HipHop for PHP created by the Facebook
    programmers, that is not being developed anymore. At a later stage, however, the transpilation was replaced by the
    HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine) project based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation.</p>
  <h2 class="text-align-justify">Lexical analysis (Lexing)</h2>
  <p class="text-align-justify">Sometimes also called tokenizing, it is a phase that literally consists of converting a
    string of characters from the source code written in PHP into a sequence of tokens that describe what each
    subsequent encountered value means. The set of tokens generated in this way helps the interpreter with processing
    the code further.</p>
  <p class="text-align-justify">Interestingly, the lexer not only handles the processing of the code into tokens, but it
    also stores the information about the value stored by the tokens, as well as about the reference to the specific
    line in which it was intercepted. This is used, among other things, to generate a stack trace of an application.
    Syntax analysis (parsing) This is another process consisting, like lexing, of processing the generated tokens into a
    more ordered and organised data structure. As with lexing, PHP uses here on an external tool called <a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/" target="_blank">GNU Bison</a> based on the <a
      href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/zend_language_parser.y" target="_blank">BNF</a> file
    containing the grammar of the language. It allows you to convert a context-free grammar into a more useful,
    cause-and-effect one. The LALR(1) method is used for conversion, which reads the input with a preview of n tokens
    forward (in the case of PHP 1) from left to right and produces a right-hand output. Through this process, the parser
    is able to match tokens to the grammar rules defined in the BNF file. In the process of matching tokens, it is
    validated whether the tokens form the correct syntax constructs.</p>
  <h2 class="text-align-justify">Compilation</h2>
  <p class="text-align-justify">Without the use of JIT, PHP in its standard form is compiled from the generated AST to
    OPCode, not – as is the case with JIT – into machine code. The compilation process is carried out by recursively
    traversing the AST, as part of which some optimisations are made as well. Most often, simple arithmetic calculations
    are performed, or the expressions such as <em>strlen("test")</em>&nbsp;are replaced with a direct <em>int(4)</em>
    value.</p>
  <h2 class="text-align-justify">Execution</h2>
  <p class="text-align-justify">This is the last phase of the interpretation process. At this stage, you actually run
    the generated OPCode on the Zend virtual machine (Zend Engine VM). The end result is what a given script was
    supposed to generate, i.e. the same as the output of commands such as <em>echo</em> or <em>print</em>. From the
    point of view of web applications, it is usually a ready source code for a website.</p>
  <h2 class="text-align-justify">Summary</h2>
  <p class="text-align-justify">Most of us do not think about how the PHP code is actually analysed and run on a server
    – especially when we entrust 
      server and application monitoring</a> to external service providers. Nevertheless, it is good to
    understand what really happens to the code of your application when it is transferred to an interpreter. Such
    knowledge can help with both the security and performance analysis of a project developed in PHP.</p>
